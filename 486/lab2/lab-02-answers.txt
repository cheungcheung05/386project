PIPELINES

Part (2)
(c) Training MSE: 1.54
(d) Test MSE: 1.75 
(e) Your answer: 0.11


Part (3)
(b) 
Feature 1: x0 x2 (coef: 147.6)
Feature 2: x2 (coef: -146.6)
Feature 3: x1 (coef: -37.2)

(c) 
Feature 1: x0 (coef: -0.08)
Feature 2: x3^2 (coef: 0.07)
Feature 3: x4^2 (coef: 0.04)

(d) y-intercept: 11.6 

Part (4) 
(c1) Best hyperparameters: 
* strategy: mean
* poly degree: 1
* n neighbors: 15
* weight: distance
(c2) Best MSE: -2.01
(d) Time: 1 minute 45 seconds
(f) test MSE: 2.1 
(g) Your answer: No

Part (5) - (Repeat of part (4))
(c1) Best hyperparameters: 
* strategy: mean
* poly degree: 1
* n neighbors: 10
* weight: distance
(c2) Best MSE: -2.05
(d) Time: 4
(f) test MSE: 1.75 
(g) Your answer: No
(h) Your answer: They both bring relatively similar results, with RandomizedSearchCV being much faster than GrdSearchCV.

Part (6) 
(b1) Training MSE: 7.932936716529455e-13
(b2) Test MSE: 1.4623776711365377 
(c) Your answer: Yes. The Test MSE lower. 

Part (7) 
(b) Your answer: Pipelines make machine learning workflow much easier and can clean up data for proper analysis. It can also reduce 
errors within the data to run proper regression analysis. 

Part (8) 
(b) Upload your CSV.  Make sure the file is named "predictions.csv", that there is only one column in the file, and there is NO header.

GRADIENT DESCENT
(c) 
beta_0: 4.85
beta_1: -0.26
beta_2: -0.09
beta_3: -0.3
beta_4: 0.28

(d) Your answer: The gradient boosting betas are super close to the normal equation betas. However, the gradient boosting 
betas are a bit tighter and closer to 0 which is a sign of a more accurate model.
